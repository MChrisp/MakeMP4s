# MakeMP4s
This script aims to make automate HandBrakeCLI, ffmpeg and dovi_tool and create you MP4 Container from raw BluRays with Dolby Vision.

You will need to install:

HandBrakeCLI: https://handbrake.fr/downloads2.php (Also try your packetmanager, might be available.)

ffmpeg: https://ffmpeg.org/ (Use your packet manager.)

dovie_tool: https://github.com/quietvoid/dovi_tool

Thanks to the creators of these tools. Without them, this obviously would not work.

Also note, that it might or might not be legal to make copies of protected movies. Do not use this script to do anything illegal.

To run this tool, just download MakeMP4s.sh and MakeMP4s.conf and chmod u+x MakeMP4s.sh, so you can run it.
Check the MakeMP4s.conf file and make according changes for your setup.
Then type bash MakeMP4s.sh in your terminal and follow instructions.

Note: All the directories you specify in the .conf will be created, if non existend. Also each movie gets its own subdirectory.

Please leave your feedback.
